## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- please make sure you changed your prot√©g√© settings to [numerical identifiers](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/wiki/Numerical-Identifiers) and got a personal ID to add new classes.

### Contribution of OEO content
Please read the [OEO best practices](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/wiki/Best-Practice-Principles) carefully.

programs used

 üî∑ - git: used for synchronising the code on your PC and online

 üçè - github: used for discussion and review

 üìô - protege: used to change the ontology

 üìó - text editor: used to change the ontology and other files


### Workflow

The workflow for contributing to this project has been inspired by the workflow described 
by [Vincent Driessen](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

**Discussion**

1. üçè Create
   [an issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue) on
   the GitHub repository describing the problem and proposed solution.

    Choose the right issue type from among the available choices:

    A) Adding a new entity to the ontology. Ideally, each issue should correspond to only one new term (with only a few subclasses, if needed)
    
    B) Restructuring existing parts of the ontology

    C) Updating definitions of existing entities in the ontology

    D) Other issue

    [Assign a project](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board#adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board-from-the-sidebar) (default "Issues") to the issue

    Discussion about the implementation should take place within the issue. **Important**: Please discuss the proposal within the issue thread **before** starting to work on a solution. For minor changes, which include small changes to improve clarity of definitions and the addition of clarifying annotations, at least one other person from the project team should agree to the proposed change before it is implemented. For major changes, which include adding new entities and restructuring the ontology, at least two other members of the project team need to agree to the change before it is implemented, which should include at least one domain expert and at least one ontology expert. Issues which are contentious, for which it is difficult to reach agreement, should be added to the agenda of the next ontology working group teleconference for discussion to reach agreement amongst the full working group. Subsequent to such discussion, the issue's first thread should be updated with a documented record of the conclusions reached.   

**Implementation**

2. üî∑ Once a solution has been agreed, create a branch from `dev` to work on your issue (see below, the "Branch naming convention" section)

    Checkout the latest stand of `dev`
    ```bash
    git checkout dev
    ```
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```
    Branch from `dev`
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/myfeature-#issueNumber
    ```
    It is best to merge one's changes *as fast as possible* (i.e. do not wait for 2 weeks) to avoid merging conflicts
3. üìô or üìó Open [Prot√©g√©](https://protege.stanford.edu/) or a text editor and work on the ontology. If you haven't already, make sure you change your prot√©g√© settings to use [numeric identifiers](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/wiki/Numerical-Identifiers). Please choose the right module of the oeo to do your changes, oeo.omn is in most cases not the right file to change. Refer to [this article](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/wiki/how-to-use-prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9-to-change-the-ontology) for detailed explanations on working with prot√©g√©.

    One can also edit the files in a text editor
4. üìô Before committing your changes, open the `oeo.omn` file with Prot√©g√© and save the file from Prot√©g√©. You should also check if you included inconsistencies by following [this ontology test procedure](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/wiki/ontology-test-guide)

    See the "Conventions" section below for commit messages format tips
5. üî∑ Get your changes online
    
    stage the files you changed
    ```bash
    git add [file_name]
    ```

    commit your changes
    ```bash
    git commit [-m " <commit_message> "]
    ```

    push your branch to the remote server

    ```bash
    git push
    ```
    If your branch does not exist on the remote server yet, git will provide you with instructions, simply follow them. 
    
    Hint: You can create a draft pull request directly after your first commit üçè, see 7.). Then you get the pull request number and üìô implement the [term tracker items](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/wiki/term-tracker-item) in Prot√©g√©. Only after finishing the implementations you can assign reviewers and thus change the state of the PR. Using that workflow, it is clear whether a PR is actually ready for review.
    
6. üçè Make sure that all automated tests are successful. This will be indicated by a green or red icon next to your most recent commit. In case an error occured that you don't know how to solve, write a comment in the PR and ask for help from the ontology-expert-team.

**Review**

7. üçè Submit a pull request (PR)
    - Follow the [steps](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) of the github help to create the PR.
    - Please note that your PR should be directed from your branch (for example `myfeature`) towards the branch `dev`
    - To make reviewing easier, briefly describe the changes you have made in the pull request and summarise the discussion and conclusions in the associated issue. 
    - Write the corresponding issue number in the pull request so that they are linked. Write it with one of the [special keywords](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords) so that the issue will be automatically closed when the PR is merged (example: `Closes #<your issue number>`)
    - Add appropriate labels. See [wiki](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/wiki/Usage-of-github-labels) for more information.
8. üìó Describe briefly (i.e. in one or two lines) what you changed in the `CHANGELOG.md` file. End the description by the number in parenthesis `(#<your PR number>)` 
9. üìô Add [term tracker items](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/wiki/term-tracker-item) to the main changed classes of the ontology

    ![img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56925445/78230560-c88ea580-74d1-11ea-921c-a9606c69563f.png)
10. üî∑ stage, commit and push the changes of steps 7 and 8
11. üçè [Ask](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users) for review of your PR.  
    As the issue will have been discussed and agreed on prior to implementation, the purpose of the review step post-implementation is to check that the implementation has been faithful to what was agreed. One or two reviewers may be needed depending on the nature of the change that has been made. If the change involves adding content (A), a domain expert should review the issue. If the change involves restructuring the ontology (B), an ontology expert should review. If the change involves both changes to content and restructuring (B and C), it is best to ask both an ontology expert and a domain expert to review. See the section "Teams tag" of the [README](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/blob/dev/README.md) for more information about the expertise of the different team members.

**Merge**

12. üçè Check that, after this whole process, your branch does not have conflicts with `dev` (GitHub will prevent you from merging if there are conflicts). In case of conflicts you are responsible for fixing them on your branch before you merge (see below "Fixing merge conflicts" section). If you need help, write a comment in the PR and ask for help from the ontology-expert-team.
    
13. üçè Once approved, merge the PR into `dev` and delete the branch on which you were working. In the merge message on github, you can notify people who are currently working on other branches that you just merged into `dev`, so they know they have to check for potential conflicts with `dev`
   
   
### Fixing merge conflicts in git

Avoid large merge conflicts by merging the updated `dev` versions in your branch.
In case of conflicts between your branch and `dev` you must solve them either online via the "resolve conflicts" button (üçè) or locally (üî∑+üìó).

1. üî∑ Get the latest version of `dev`
    ```bash
    git checkout dev
    ```
   
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```
    
2. Switch to your branch

    ```bash
    git checkout <your branch>
    ```
    
3. Merge `dev` into your branch
    ```bash
    git merge dev
    ```
    
4. üìó The conflicts have to be [manually](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line) resolved
    

### Conventions for git and GitHub

üî∑ The convention is to always have `feature/` in the branch name. The `myfeature` part should describe shortly what the feature is about (separate words with `_` or `-`). It is also nice to end the branch name with the issue number it is linked to:

Examples of branch names : `feature/solving-duplicate-problems-#11` or `feature/add_ontology_new_class_#43`

If the branch purpose is to fix a problem `feature/` can be replaced by `fix/`

Try to follow [these conventions](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit) for commit messages:
- Keep the subject line [short](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#limit-50) (i.e. do not commit more than a few changes at the time)
- Use [imperative](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative) for commit messages 
- Do not end the commit message with a [period](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#end) 

You can use 
```bash
git commit --amend
```
to edit the commit message of your latest commit (provided it is not already pushed on the remote server).
With `--amend` you can even add/modify changes to the commit.
